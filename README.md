An open-source dev tool for building fully functional server-side Node.js apps with React clients...blazing fast!

## [Getting Started](https://docs.amplication.com/docs/getting-started)

Try amplication immediately on [amplication.com](http://amplication.com/)
or [follow the instructions](#development) to run it locally

## Features

Build business applications with:

- Visually managed data models
- Auto-generated human-editable source code
- Node.js server built with Nest.js and Passport with REST API and GraphQL
- Admin UI built with React
- Role-based access control
- OOB Docker and docker-compose integration

## Development

Amplication is constructed of multiple packages. To start working on Amplication follow the "Amplication Server" and "Amplication Client" installation instructions.

### [Amplication Server](./packages/amplication-server/README.md)

Amplication Server is the main component of the platform that provides all the core functionality to design and create low-code applications.
The server exposes a GraphQL API for all actions. The server is built with the following awesome open-source technologies: Node.js, NestJS, Prisma over PostgreSQL, GraphQL API, and many more...

### [Amplication Client](./packages/amplication-client/README.md)

Amplication Client is the front end of the platform that provides you with an easy to drive UI for building your next low-code application.
The client is based on React, Apollo client, Primer components, React Material Web Components, Formik, and more.

## Other packages

### [Amplication Data Service Generator](./packages/amplication-data-service-generator/README.md)

Amplication Data Service Generator is the component that generates the server-side code (models, Prisma client, REST API, authentication, and authorization filters) of the application built with Amplication. This package is used internally by Amplication server.

To use this package as a library or as a CLI with other projects, follow the instructions on the package page.

### [Amplication Scheduler](./packages/scheduler/README.md)

Amplication Scheduler is a simple HTTP cron job scheduler.
The service is integrated with Docker and Docker Compose.

## Alpha version

Please note that Amplication is currently in alpha version. <b>This means that any app data hosted on our cloud can get reset at any time.</b> At this point if you want to use your app in a production environment, you'll need to download the app as a Docker container and deploy on your own cloud service.
