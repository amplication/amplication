This is a sample blog built by Amplication and NextJs

I use Amplication as the backend of my blog. That saves a lot of time because I don't need to write any lines of code to setup the CMS. UI is rendered from server side with NextJs ( template from Next.js tutorial. )

Client repo: https://github.com/thucpn/amplication-client-demo

Server repo (generated by amplication): https://github.com/thucpn/amplication-server-demo
