# Amplication Client

Amplication Client is the front end of the platform that provides the beautiful UI to build your next low-code application.
The client is built with React, Apollo client, Primer components, React Material Web Components, Formik, and many more.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Setup

Amplication is using a mono-repo with multiple packages. To initialize all the packages on a local development environment, follow the [Getting Started With Local Development](/README.md#getting-started-with-local-development) section to do that in a few quick steps.

## Useful Targets

Targets can be run using Nx Workspaces. You can read more about targets in the [Nx Documentation](https://nx.dev/reference/project-configuration).

You can find a full list of targets in the [project.json](/Users/arielweinberger/Development/amplication/amplication/packages/amplication-client/project.json) file.
